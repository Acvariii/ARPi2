  "background": "You were shaped by long nights, short tempers, and longer roads.\n\nYou grew up in quiet village, and you learned to lean on compassion\u2014even when it made you stubborn. When curiosity pulled you onto the road, you didn\u2019t hesitate for long. An old debt still casts a long shadow.\n\nYour greatest flaw is suspicion, and you\u2019re not proud of the damage it\u2019s caused. Still, a cause keeps you standing when the odds turn. You carry a token as a reminder of who you were before you became a wizard.\n\nUnique detail: Boobs\n\nYou measure your life in promises kept, not battles won.",
