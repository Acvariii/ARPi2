When revenge pulled you onto the road, you didn\u2019t hesitate for long. A stranger\u2019s words lodged in your mind like a splinter.\n\nYour greatest flaw is impulsiveness, and you\u2019re not proud of the damage it\u2019s caused. Still, a person keeps you standing when the odds turn. You carry a map as a reminder of who you were before you became a fighter.\n\nUnique detail: Test\n\nYou don\u2019t seek glory\u2014only a reason to believe you can make things right.",
